# Azuriom Status Page
The Status Page Plugin was created for the simple needs of [Craft Global](https://craftglobal.org) because they wanted to check the status of all their servers and all display it publicly to their players.
This project has a public demo page of the [status page](https://loungemc.net/statuspage), however, you can see a [custom one here](https://craftglobal.org/statuspage) soon.

Minecraft Status Checking Powered by [xPaw's Minecraft Query](https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query). We plan to add support other checks in the future.
